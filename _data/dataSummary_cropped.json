Fossil fuel plants in the 1980s which were based in midwest emitted gases such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide. These were carried towards the north east by the wind patterns and mixed with the rainwater, fog and snow there, lowering the pH of water, making it acidic. A long-term monitoring of atmospheric deposition revealed that it was acid rain that caused the decline of several trees, including 300-year-old red spruce trees, and lakes of the green mountain. Similar well documented occurrences of acid rain have happened in other parts of the world, such as Norway, Germany, China and India. The pattern of its occurrence in each region corresponds with the surge of industrialisation in that region.  The sound is represented by a field recording of a Vermont rain storm, re-sampled and processed to add a sizzling and splatting element in order to evoke acid rain.",

Black soot is formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel. It gets transported by wind, mixes with rainwater and snow, and settles on glaciers. This leads to darkening of the surface of the glacier. The glaciers being white, have high albedo. This means they are able to reflect back most of the sunlight without absorbing it. Due to the presence of soot, they absorb sunlight and reduce the reflecting capacity of the glacier.This soot then contributes to the melting of the surface of the glacier. The soot received in the Tibetan glaciers in this study is mostly from Europe and the Middle East in the past.

The samples of milk were taken from seven different sites, chosen to reflect major agricultural, industrial and population centres in Kazakhstan.

PCB toxicity was high in one of the sampled sites, Atyaru. Another pesticide DDE showed high levels in rural areas.

    "desc": "Plachimada was a little hamlet in the southern Indian state of Kerala. A semi-arid region between two large reservoirs and ten metres south of an irrigation canal, it was abundant with coconut groves and vegetable cultivation.Coca-Cola set up one of its largest bottling plants in the village of Plachimada in 1998. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) granted the company a permit to produce 561,000 litres of beverage per day, with an average requirement of 3.8 litres of water for a litre of beverage. The source of water was primarily groundwater, and about two million litres of water per day was extracted. Within two years of its commissioning, the water table of a water abundant village depleted from 45 meters to 150 meters below the ground level district. Hundreds of wells dried up in the area causing people to walk kilometers away for potable drinking water. The sound is represented by cascading Coca Cola sounds, derived from the classic Suzanne Ciani synthesized Coca Cola advertisement.",

    "desc": "The Rhine is one of the major rivers of Europe, the second longest in Central and Western Europe, after the Danube. The convention of 1831 gave an international status to the Rhine, giving riparian nations the right to use its waters for navigation and commerce. This resulted in the development of major industries, thermal industries in particular, on the banks of the river. As a result, the Rhine river became the most thermally polluted basin in the world. It has suffered abuse such as decades of untreated industrial and domestic waste and incessant thermal pollution, 75% of  which come from nuclear power plants. The case study uses Thermal Infrared Remote Sensors to investigate the detrimental effects of power plants on the temperature of the Rhine river, on the banks of which they are located. The sound is represented by a field recording of the Rhine combined with sounds from a nuclear power plant, and manipulated to evoke evaporation and contamination.",

Just like Lake Tai Hu, Chou Hu has also suffered from the settlement of industries around the lake bed. The main causes for eutrophication of the lake is due to the amount of pollutants discharged into the lake. The dataset compares the nutrients–total nitrogen and total phosphorus carried by 11 rivers that flow into Lake Chaohu using water samples and sediment cores for the analysis of the pH. An instrument called the UV-Visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorption spectrum for nitrate (NO-3) which shows a peak at 224 nm depending on the amount of  NO-3 in the sample. The sound is represented by recordings of water combined with the frequency of Nitrogen and re-sampled to evoke sludgy, polluted water.",

It contains 97% of India’s chromium ore deposits, and has one of the largest open cast chromite ore mines in the world. In the year 2007, the US-based Blacksmith Institute released a report taking a range of parameters to identify the ten most polluted places in the world. Sukinda was one of them. A study by Odisha-based non-profit Environment Protection Group revealed that the percentage of hexavalent chromium (Cr+6) in the rivers is higher than the permissible limit. Approximately 70% of the surface water and 60% of the drinking water contains hexavalent chromium at more than double national and international standards and levels of over 20 times the standard have been recorded. Hexavalent chromium is a known human carcinogen and adversely affects human health. The sound is represented by synthesized mining sounds, manipulated to create additional dusty and sludgy textures, and a repeating tone at 1907Hz (derived from the 1907 C melting point of Chromium).",
